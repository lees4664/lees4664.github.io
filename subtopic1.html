    <td>This video made by Amelia Hugil-Fontanel, the faculty of Rochester Institute of Technology thoroughly explains what letterpress printing is step by step. The beginning of the video is mainly about what the school offers in terms of printing facilities, and Fontanel soon explores different options, metal types, designs, and the history of letterpress in detail, giving easy-to-understand and viewer-friendly examples. What makes it a valuable source is the fact that the concept and technology involved in relief printing, moveable printing, and letterpress are explained along with appropriate image and video references. With a thorough exploration of the whole beginning-to-end process of the relief printing method, this video will aid viewers in having a further understanding of the subject.</td>
